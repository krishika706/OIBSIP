                <p>
                    Hello! I am a Computer Engineering student with a strong passion for learning and exploring new technologies. Currently, I am in my second year at RC Patel Institute of Technology, where I am building a solid foundation in computer science and software development.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    I have developed practical knowledge of front-end web technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enabling me to design and build responsive and user-friendly websites. In addition, I possess a basic understanding of programming languages such as Python and Java, which has helped me strengthen my problem-solving and logical thinking skills.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    I am continuously working on improving my technical abilities by building projects and learning modern development practices. My goal is to grow as a skilled software developer and contribute effectively to innovative and impactful technology solutions.
